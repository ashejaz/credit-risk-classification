For this project, logistic regression models were trained to classify loans as either healthy or high-risk.

The source data can be found [here](Credit_Risk/Resources/lending_data.csv).

The script for the model can be found [here](Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb).

Finally, a report containing analysis of the models' performance can be found [here](Credit_Risk/credit_risk_analysis.md).
